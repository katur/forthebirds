    Since her heart attack in 2015, Laura has cut back on travel and speaking
    engagements. To accomplish that, and because she has so little saved for a
    retirement that will be coming sooner rather than later (before the heart
    attack, she thought she'd be working forever), she's raised her rates.
    Besides her speaking fee (which we can negotiate), she must be compensated
    for travel expenses ($0.57.5 per mile plus lodging costs en route, or
    reimbursement for flying and car rental) and lodging during the event for
    herself and her plucky sidekick Pip the Birding Dog. She makes exceptions in
    a few situations, for organizations that she wants to support and/or for
    exceptional birding and bird photography opportunities or other personal
    reasons. She truly can no longer afford the time and exhaustion of most
    programs below her asking rate.
