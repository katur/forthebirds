## Code

Django/Python. Scripts live in the standard location
(`appname/management/commands`).

Javascript uses [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

CSS is in [SASS](http://sass-lang.com).
[gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js) can be used to automate the compilation of
SASS in development.
To set up, assuming [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com) is installed on the
system, run the following in the project root (which will install the
dependencies---listed in [package.json](package.json)---in a git-ignored
directory called `node_modules`):
```
npm install --dev-save
```

And to start the gulp build script, run the following in the project root:
```
gulp
```
